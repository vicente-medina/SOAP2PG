# SOAP2PG

Project to use PYTHON to consume SOAP webservice and dump the results to a PostgreSQL database.

The project is not parametrized, therefore in case of reusing requires some work.

It is based in zeep but the library is slightly modified to deal with some issues found in the project sebservice.
